                            Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital
                            money. It is the first
                            decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central
                            authority or middlemen. From a
                            user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be
                            seen as the most prominent
                            triple entry bookkeeping system in existence.

                        <p class="faq-texts" id="who-answer">Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called
                            "cryptocurrency", which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai
                            on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of money that uses
                            cryptography to control its
                            creation and transactions, rather than a central authority. The first Bitcoin specification
                            and proof of concept was
                            published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi left the
                            project in late 2010 without
                            revealing much about himself. The community has since grown exponentially with many
                            developers working on Bitcoin.

                            Satoshi's anonymity often raised unjustified concerns, many of which are linked to
                            misunderstanding of the open-source
                            nature of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol and software are published openly and any developer
                            around the world can review
                            the code or make their own modified version of the Bitcoin software. Just like current
                            developers, Satoshi's influence
                            was limited to the changes he made being adopted by others and therefore he did not control
                            Bitcoin. As such, the
                            identity of Bitcoin's inventor is probably as relevant today as the identity of the person
                            who invented paper.

                        <p class="faq-texts" id="how-answer">From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a
                            mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Bitcoin
                            wallet and allows a user to send and receive bitcoins with them. This is how Bitcoin works
                            for most users.

                            Behind the scenes, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the "block chain".
                            This ledger contains every
                            transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each
                            transaction. The authenticity of
                            each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses,
                            allowing all users to have
                            full control over sending bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. In addition, anyone can
                            process transactions using
                            the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service.
                            This is often called
                            "mining". To learn more about Bitcoin, you can consult the dedicated page and the original
                            paper.</p>

                            Payments are made from a wallet application, either on your computer or smartphone, by
                            entering the recipient's address,
                            the payment amount, and pressing send. To make it easier to enter a recipient's address,
                            many wallets can obtain the

                            illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some
                            jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies.
                            Other jurisdictions (such as
                            Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as Bitcoin exchanges.

                            Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses
                            with rules on how to
                            integrate this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the
                            Financial Crimes Enforcement
                            Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding
                            guidance on how it characterizes
                            certain activities involving virtual currencies.</p>

                        <p class="faq-texts" id="what-about-answer">Bitcoin is freeing people to transact on their own
                            terms. Each user can send and receive payments in a similar way to
                            cash but they can also take part in more complex contracts. Multiple signatures allow a
                            transaction to be accepted by
                            the network only if a certain number of a defined group of persons agree to sign the
                            transaction. This allows innovative
                            dispute mediation services to be developed in the future. Such services could allow a third
                            party to approve or reject a
                            transaction in case of disagreement between the other parties without having control on
                            their money. As opposed to cash
                            and other payment methods, Bitcoin always leaves a public proof that a transaction did take
                            place, which can potentially
                            be used in a recourse against businesses with fraudulent practices.

                            It is also worth noting that while merchants usually depend on their public reputation to
                            remain in business and pay
                            their employees, they don't have access to the same level of information when dealing with
                            new consumers. The way
                            Bitcoin works allows both individuals and businesses to be protected against fraudulent
                            chargebacks while giving the

                        <p class="faq-texts" id="determine-answer">The price of a bitcoin is determined by supply and
                            demand. When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and
                            when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in
                            circulation and new bitcoins are
                            created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level
                            of inflation to keep the
                            price stable. Because Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could
                            be, it doesn't take
                            significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a
                            bitcoin is still very
                            volatile.</p>

                        <p class="faq-texts" id="is-ponzi-answer">A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation
                            that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the
                            money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individuals running
                            the business. Ponzi schemes
                            are designed to collapse at the expense of the last investors when there is not enough new
                            participants.

                            Bitcoin is a free software project with no central authority. Consequently, no one is in a
                            position to make fraudulent
                            representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United
                            States dollar, euro, yen,
                            etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate floats freely. This leads
                            to volatility where owners
                            of bitcoins can unpredictably make or lose money. Beyond speculation, Bitcoin is also a
                            payment system with useful and
                            competitive attributes that are being used by thousands of users and businesses.</p>

                            with Bitcoin. However, there is a delay before the network begins
                            to confirm your transaction by including it in a block. A confirmation means that there is a
                            consensus on the network
                            that the bitcoins you received haven't been sent to anyone else and are considered your
                            property. Once your transaction
                            has been included in one block, it will continue to be buried under every block after it,
                            which will exponentially
                            consolidate this consensus and decrease the risk of a reversed transaction. Each
                            confirmation takes between a few
                            seconds and 90 minutes, with 10 minutes being the average. If the transaction pays too low a
                            fee or is otherwise
                            atypical, getting the first confirmation can take much longer. Every user is free to
                            determine at what point they
                            consider a transaction sufficiently confirmed, but 6 confirmations is often considered to be
                            as safe as waiting 6 months
                            on a credit card transaction.</p>

                            start your wallet application. Bitcoins are not actually
                            received by the software on your computer, they are appended to a public ledger that is
                            shared between all the devices
                            on the network. If you are sent bitcoins when your wallet client program is not running and
                            you later launch it, it will
                            download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about, and the
                            bitcoins will eventually
                            appear as if they were just received in real time. Your wallet is only needed when you wish
